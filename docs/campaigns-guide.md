# Campaigns & Projects Page Guide

This guide will help you set up and manage your Campaigns & Projects page correctly.

## What's Been Fixed

1. The "View All Campaigns" button now correctly points to a page using your custom template (`template-campaigns.php`) rather than the default archive page.

2. Added the featured campaign functionality so you can highlight important campaigns at the top of the page.

3. Enhanced the styling with Ankara-inspired borders and animations to make the page more visually appealing.

## How to Set Up Your Campaigns Page

### Step 1: Create a Page with the Custom Template

1. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Navigate to Pages > Add New
3. Give it the title "Campaigns & Projects"
4. In the right sidebar, under Page Attributes, select "Campaigns & Projects Showcase" from the Template dropdown
5. Add a brief description in the content area if desired
6. Publish the page

### Step 2: Create Sample Campaigns

1. Go to Campaigns > Add New in your WordPress admin
2. Create several campaigns with:
   - Title (e.g., "Social Media Campaign for XYZ")
   - Content/description 
   - Select a Platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Project, Campaign)
   - Add a featured image
   - Add the URL (if applicable)
   - Check "Set as featured campaign" for your most important campaign

3. Repeat this process to create at least 5-6 campaigns so your page looks populated

### Step 3: Test the Page

1. Visit your front page
2. Click on the "View All Campaigns & Projects" button
3. Verify that it takes you to your campaigns page with the custom template
4. Verify that your featured campaign appears at the top

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. **Button not working**: Make sure you've created a page with the "Campaigns & Projects Showcase" template as described above.

2. **No campaigns appearing**: Check that you've created campaign posts with the "portfolio_campaign" post type.

3. **Featured campaign not showing**: Make sure you've checked the "Set as featured campaign" option for at least one campaign.

4. **Styling issues**: Make sure your theme's CSS is properly loading and not conflicting with the campaigns styling.
